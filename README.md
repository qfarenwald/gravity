# gravity

Gravity is a React-Redux App allows a user to view mountain bike trails in a targeted area and book a shuttle to take them to the top of that trail.

### Focuses

- Write squeaky clean, well refactored code using ES6 syntax.

- Make informed design decisions to create a user-friendly application.

- Become comfortable with different network requests like GET, POST, & DELETE.

- Solidify concepts with React to create clean and re-useable components.

- Become comfortable with Reduxâ€™s lifecycle, creating actions, reducers, and connecting them to React components.

- Understand and solidify concepts with React component, asynchronous code, and Redux testing.

- Get more practice doing network requests with a backend.

### Screenshots
Data Map

Book Your Shuttle
- Now that a trail is selected and the user decides that is the trail they wish to hire a shuttle for, they will fill out the form with the necessary information.
